    <p>Here's a step-by-step guide on sowing tomato seeds:</p>
    <p>Steps for Sowing Tomato Seeds in a Farm:</p>

    <h4>1. Prepare the Soil:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Choose a well-drained, fertile area in your farm with good sunlight exposure.</li>
        <li>Loosen the soil to a depth of a few inches using a rake or hoe. Remove debris, rocks, and weeds.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2. Seed Spacing and Depth:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Create rows in the soil, keeping a distance of about 18-36 inches between rows, depending on the tomato variety and available space.</li>
        <li>Sow tomato seeds along the rows, spacing them about 1/4 to 1/2 inch deep in the soil. Space seeds about 2-3 inches apart.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>3. Covering and Watering:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Cover the seeds lightly with soil and gently pat the soil to ensure good seed-to-soil contact.</li>
        <li>Water the seeded area thoroughly but gently, ensuring the soil is moist but not waterlogged.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>4. Labeling and Marking:</h4>
    <p>Consider labeling the rows or using markers to identify the tomato variety and the planting date. This helps in keeping track as they grow.</p>

    <h4>5. Maintenance:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge. In dry conditions, regular watering might be necessary.</li>
        <li>Remove weeds as they appear to prevent competition for nutrients and space.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>6. Thinning (if needed):</h4>
    <p>Once the seedlings emerge and develop a few true leaves, thin them out if they are overcrowded, leaving the healthiest and strongest plants with adequate space.</p>

    <h4>7. Support Structures (if applicable):</h4>
    <p>Depending on the tomato variety (especially indeterminate types), consider installing support structures like stakes, trellises, or cages as the plants grow to provide support and prevent sprawling.</p>

    <h4>8. Monitor and Care:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Regularly monitor the plants for pests, diseases, and nutrient deficiencies. Take appropriate measures if any issues arise.</li>
        <li>Ensure adequate watering and consider mulching to retain soil moisture and suppress weeds.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>9. Transplanting (if applicable):</h4>
    <p>If you have started seedlings in a nursery, you can transplant them into the farm once they are sturdy and have a few sets of true leaves.</p>

    <h4>10. Harvesting and Maintenance:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>As the plants grow, provide regular care and maintenance, such as fertilizing as needed and supporting the growing vines.</li>
        <li>Harvest ripe tomatoes as they mature, and continue monitoring for any signs of issues.</li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <p>By following these steps and providing proper care, you can ensure healthy tomato plants and a successful harvest on your farm.</p>
