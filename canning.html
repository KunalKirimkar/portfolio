    <p>Canning is a popular preservation method used to extend the shelf life of tomatoes and other fruits and vegetables. It involves heat-processing foods in sealed containers to kill bacteria, yeasts, and molds that cause spoilage. Canned tomatoes can be stored at room temperature for an extended period, making them convenient for long-term storage and use. Here's an overview of the canning process for tomatoes:</p>

    <h4>1. Gather Equipment and Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Large stockpot or canner with a rack</li>
        <li>Canning jars, lids, and bands</li>
        <li>Jar lifter</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce, crushed tomatoes, or whole tomatoes</li>
        <li>Lemon juice or citric acid (for acidification, if needed)</li>
        <li>Salt (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2. Prepare Tomatoes:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Wash tomatoes thoroughly under running water to remove any dirt or debris.</li>
        <li>Remove stems and any blemishes or bruises from the tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Blanch tomatoes in boiling water for 30-60 seconds, then transfer them to an ice bath to cool quickly. This helps loosen the skins for easier peeling.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>3. Peel and Chop Tomatoes (Optional):</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Peel blanched tomatoes by slipping off the skins with your fingers or using a knife.</li>
        <li>Core and chop tomatoes as desired. They can be left whole, diced, crushed, or pureed, depending on your preference and intended use.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>4. Fill Jars:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Pack prepared tomatoes into clean, hot canning jars, leaving a ½-inch headspace at the top to allow for expansion during processing.</li>
        <li>If adding salt, lemon juice, or citric acid for acidification, follow recommended guidelines for the amount to add per jar based on the recipe or canning instructions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>5. Remove Air Bubbles and Adjust Headspace:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Use a plastic or wooden utensil to remove any air bubbles trapped in the jars by running it along the inside edge of the jar.</li>
        <li>Adjust the headspace as needed by adding more tomatoes or liquid to maintain the specified ½-inch headspace.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>6. Wipe Jar Rims and Apply Lids:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Wipe the rims of the jars with a clean, damp cloth to remove any residue or food particles.</li>
        <li>Place prepared lids on the jars and screw on the bands fingertip-tight. Do not overtighten.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>7. Process Jars in Boiling Water Bath:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Place filled jars on a rack in the canner or large stockpot filled with enough boiling water to cover the jars by at least 1-2 inches.</li>
        <li>Process jars in boiling water for the recommended time specified in the recipe or canning guidelines, based on jar size and altitude.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>8. Remove Jars and Cool:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>After processing, carefully remove jars from the canner using a jar lifter and place them on a towel or rack to cool.</li>
        <li>Allow jars to cool undisturbed for 12-24 hours. As they cool, you may hear the lids "ping" as they seal.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>9. Check Seals and Store:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>After cooling, check the seals by pressing down on the center of each lid. If the lid does not flex or pop, it is sealed.</li>
        <li>Label sealed jars with the contents and date, then store them in a cool, dark place for up to 1 year.</li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <p>Following these steps ensures safe and successful canning of tomatoes, providing you with delicious and shelf-stable tomato products to enjoy throughout the year. Always refer to reputable canning guidelines or resources for specific instructions and safety recommendations.</p>
