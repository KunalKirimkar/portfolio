    <p>Post-harvest management is crucial for maintaining the quality, freshness, and shelf life of tomatoes after they have been harvested. Here are important steps and considerations for post-harvest handling of tomatoes:</p>

    <h4>1. Cleaning and Sorting:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Remove any dirt, debris, or field heat from harvested tomatoes by gently washing them with clean water. Avoid excessive washing to prevent damage.</li>
        <li>Sort tomatoes based on size, color, ripeness, and quality to separate marketable fruit from culls or damaged tomatoes.</li>
    </ul> 

    <h4>2. Drying:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>After washing, allow tomatoes to air dry or use clean towels or cloths to gently pat them dry before packing. Dry tomatoes are less prone to spoilage during storage and transportation.</li>
    </ul> 
    
    <h4>3. Packaging:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Pack tomatoes in clean, sturdy containers or packaging materials suitable for transportation and retail display. Options include cardboard boxes, plastic crates, or ventilated containers.</li>
        <li>Avoid over-packing or stacking tomatoes, as excessive pressure can lead to bruising and damage.</li>
    </ul> 
    
    <h4>4. Storage:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Store tomatoes in a cool, well-ventilated environment to slow down ripening and extend shelf life. Ideal storage conditions for tomatoes typically range from 55째F to 70째F (13째C to 21째C) with a relative humidity of 85-90%.</li>
        <li>Avoid storing tomatoes near ethylene-producing fruits such as bananas or apples, as ethylene can accelerate ripening and reduce shelf life.</li>
        <li>Monitor stored tomatoes regularly for signs of overripening, decay, or spoilage, and remove any damaged fruit promptly to prevent the spread of rot.</li>
    </ul> 
    
    <h4>5. Temperature Management:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Consider using temperature-controlled storage facilities or refrigeration units to maintain optimal storage conditions for tomatoes, especially during periods of high ambient temperatures or hot weather.</li>
        <li>Use pre-cooling methods such as hydrocooling or forced-air cooling to rapidly lower the temperature of harvested tomatoes, reducing heat stress and extending shelf life.</li>
    </ul> 
    
    <h4>6. Transportation:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Handle harvested tomatoes with care during transportation to minimize bruising and damage. Use insulated vehicles or refrigerated trucks to maintain temperature control and preserve quality.</li>
        <li>Securely stack containers or pallets of tomatoes to prevent shifting or movement during transit, which can cause bruising and spoilage.</li>
    </ul> 
    
    <h4>7. Market Preparation:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Prepare tomatoes for market by labeling containers with product information such as variety, size, and grade.</li>
        <li>Ensure that tomatoes are displayed attractively and in a clean, well-organized manner to appeal to customers and maximize sales.</li>
    </ul> 
    
    <h4>8. Quality Control:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Implement quality control measures throughout the post-harvest handling process to identify and remove any substandard or defective tomatoes before they reach consumers.</li>
        <li>Keep records of post-harvest activities, including storage temperatures, handling procedures, and any quality issues encountered, to track performance and make improvements.</li>
    </ul>    
    
    <br>
    <p>By following these post-harvest management practices, growers can maximize the quality, freshness, and marketability of their tomatoes, ensuring customer satisfaction and minimizing waste.</p>
