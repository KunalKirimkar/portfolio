    <p>Canning tomatoes with acidification is a crucial step to ensure their safety for long-term storage. Tomatoes are naturally low in acid, which means they have a pH level that is not acidic enough to prevent the growth of harmful bacteria like Clostridium botulinum, which can cause botulism. Acidification involves adding acid, typically in the form of lemon juice or citric acid, to increase the acidity of the tomatoes to a safe level for canning. Here's how to can tomatoes with acidification:</p>

    <h4>1. Gather Equipment and Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Fresh tomatoes</li>
        <li>Canning jars, lids, and bands</li>
        <li>Lemon juice or citric acid</li>
        <li>Salt (optional)</li>
        <li>Large stockpot or canner with a rack</li>
        <li>Jar lifter</li>
        <li>Canning funnel (optional)</li>
        <li>Cutting board and knife</li>
        <li>Towels or cloths</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2. Prepare Tomatoes:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Wash the tomatoes thoroughly under cold running water to remove any dirt or debris.</li>
        <li>Remove stems and any blemishes or bruises from the tomatoes.</li>
        <li>If desired, blanch the tomatoes in boiling water for 30-60 seconds to loosen the skins, then transfer them to an ice bath to cool. Peel off the skins.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>3. Prepare Canning Jars:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Wash canning jars, lids, and bands in hot, soapy water and rinse well.</li>
        <li>Sterilize jars by placing them in boiling water for 10 minutes or running them through a dishwasher cycle.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>4. Acidification:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Add lemon juice or citric acid to each jar before filling with tomatoes. The recommended amount of acid to add depends on the size of the jars and the acidity of the tomatoes. Follow USDA guidelines or a tested recipe for the correct amount of acid to use.</li>
        <li>If using lemon juice, add 1 tablespoon of lemon juice per pint jar and 2 tablespoons per quart jar. If using citric acid, dissolve 1/4 teaspoon of citric acid in 1 cup of water and add 2 tablespoons of the solution per pint jar or 4 tablespoons per quart jar.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>5. Pack Tomatoes in Jars:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Pack prepared tomatoes into the sterilized jars, leaving about 1/2 inch of headspace at the top.</li>
        <li>Add salt to each jar if desired, following USDA guidelines for safe canning practices.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>6. Remove Air Bubbles and Seal Jars:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Use a clean utensil to remove any air bubbles trapped in the jars by running it along the inside edge of the jar.</li>
        <li>Wipe the rims of the jars with a clean, damp cloth to remove any residue or spills.</li>
        <li>Place sterilized lids and bands on the jars and tighten them fingertip-tight.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>7. Process Jars in Boiling Water Bath:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Place filled jars on a rack in the canner or large stockpot filled with enough boiling water to cover the jars by at least 1-2 inches.</li>
        <li>Process jars in boiling water for the recommended time specified in the recipe or canning guidelines, based on jar size and altitude.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>8. Cool and Store:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>After processing, carefully remove jars from the canner using a jar lifter and place them on a towel or rack to cool.</li>
        <li>Let jars cool undisturbed for 12-24 hours. As they cool, you may hear the lids "ping" as they seal.</li>
        <li>Check the seals by pressing down on the center of each lid. If the lid does not flex or pop, it is sealed.</li>
        <li>Label sealed jars with the contents and date, then store them in a cool, dark place for up to 1 year.</li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <p>By following these steps and properly acidifying the tomatoes before canning, you can safely preserve them for long-term storage and enjoy their flavor in various dishes throughout the year. Always use tested recipes and follow USDA guidelines for safe canning practices to prevent the risk of foodborne illness.</p>
